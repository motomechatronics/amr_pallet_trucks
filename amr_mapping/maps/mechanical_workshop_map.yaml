# image : Path to the image file containing the occupancy data; can be absolute, or relative to the location of the YAML file
# resolution : Resolution of the map, meters / pixel
# origin : The 2-D pose of the lower-left pixel in the map, as (x, y, yaw), with yaw as counterclockwise rotation (yaw=0 means no rotation). Many parts of the system currently ignore yaw.
# occupied_thresh : Pixels with occupancy probability greater than this threshold are considered completely occupied.
# free_thresh : Pixels with occupancy probability less than this threshold are considered completely free.
# negate : Whether the white/black free/occupied semantics should be reversed (interpretation of thresholds is unaffected)
